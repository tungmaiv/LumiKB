# Understanding Citations and Trust

One of LumiKB's most important features is its citation system. Every AI-generated answer includes references to the exact source documents, enabling you to verify accuracy and build trust in the system.

## Why Citations Matter

AI systems can sometimes generate plausible-sounding but incorrect information. LumiKB addresses this challenge by:

- Grounding all answers in your actual documents
- Providing direct links to source material
- Showing the specific text passages used
- Enabling quick verification

## How Citations Work

When you ask a question, LumiKB performs several steps:

### Semantic Search

First, the system searches your Knowledge Base for relevant content. Unlike keyword search, semantic search understands meaning. For example, searching for "authentication" will also find content about "login", "sign-in", and "user verification".

### Answer Synthesis

The AI reads the relevant passages and synthesizes a coherent answer. Each piece of information in the answer is tagged with its source.

### Citation Generation

Citations appear as numbered references in the answer, like this: "Users must verify their email address before accessing the system [1]."

## Verifying Citations

Click any citation number to see:

- **Document Name**: Which document contains the source
- **Section**: The specific section or heading
- **Passage**: The exact text that supports the claim
- **Page Number**: For PDFs, the page location

## Trust Indicators

LumiKB provides visual cues to help you assess answer reliability:

### Citation Count

More citations generally indicate a more comprehensive answer drawn from multiple sources.

### Source Diversity

Answers citing multiple documents show broader knowledge base coverage.

### Relevance Scores

Each citation includes a relevance score indicating how closely the source matches your question.

## Best Practices

### Verify Important Information

For critical decisions, always click through to the source documents. The AI provides a starting point, but human verification ensures accuracy.

### Check Citation Context

Sometimes the cited passage may have important context before or after it. Use the "View in Document" feature to see the full context.

### Report Discrepancies

If you find an answer that doesn't match its citations, use the feedback system to report it. This helps improve the system over time.

## Common Questions

### What if there are no citations?

If LumiKB cannot find relevant content in your Knowledge Base, it will tell you rather than guessing. This is a feature, not a limitation.

### Can I trust the citations?

Citations always link to real content in your documents. The AI cannot fabricate sources. However, the interpretation of that content may occasionally be imperfect.

### How do I improve citation quality?

Upload well-structured documents with clear headings and logical organization. This helps LumiKB create better chunks and more accurate citations.

## Summary

LumiKB's citation system bridges the gap between AI convenience and human oversight. By always showing its sources, LumiKB enables you to work faster while maintaining the accuracy standards your organization requires.
