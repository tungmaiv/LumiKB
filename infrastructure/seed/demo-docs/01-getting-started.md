# Getting Started with LumiKB

Welcome to LumiKB, your enterprise knowledge management platform powered by AI. This guide will help you understand the core concepts and get you up and running quickly.

## What is LumiKB?

LumiKB is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) platform that transforms how organizations manage and access their knowledge. Instead of searching through countless documents manually, you can simply ask questions in natural language and receive accurate, cited answers.

### Key Features

- **Semantic Search**: Find information based on meaning, not just keywords
- **AI-Powered Q&A**: Ask questions and get synthesized answers from your documents
- **Verifiable Citations**: Every answer includes references to source documents
- **Knowledge Base Organization**: Group related documents into logical collections
- **Document Generation**: Create new documents using your existing knowledge

## Core Concepts

### Knowledge Bases

A Knowledge Base (KB) is a collection of related documents. Think of it as a smart folder that understands its contents. You might create separate Knowledge Bases for:

- Product documentation
- Engineering specifications
- Customer support articles
- Research papers
- Company policies

### Documents

Documents are the building blocks of your Knowledge Bases. LumiKB supports various formats including PDF, Word documents, and Markdown files. When you upload a document, LumiKB:

1. Extracts the text content
2. Breaks it into meaningful chunks
3. Creates semantic embeddings for search
4. Indexes everything for instant retrieval

### Permissions

LumiKB provides granular access control with three permission levels:

- **Read**: View documents and search content
- **Write**: Upload and manage documents
- **Admin**: Full control including user permissions

## Your First Search

Once you have documents in a Knowledge Base, searching is simple:

1. Select a Knowledge Base from the sidebar
2. Type your question in natural language
3. Review the AI-generated answer
4. Check the citations to verify accuracy

For example, instead of searching "authentication flow diagram", you could ask:
"How does user authentication work in our system?"

LumiKB will find relevant sections across all your documents and synthesize a comprehensive answer.

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the basics, explore these topics:

- **Citations and Trust**: Learn how to verify AI-generated answers
- **Knowledge Base Management**: Create and organize your own Knowledge Bases
- **Search and Q&A Features**: Master advanced search capabilities

LumiKB is designed to grow with your organization. Start with a single Knowledge Base, and expand as your needs evolve.
