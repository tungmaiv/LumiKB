## Executive Summary

LumiKB is an enterprise RAG-powered knowledge management platform built on a **citation-first architecture** that ensures every AI-generated statement traces back to source documents. The architecture prioritizes trust through verifiability, on-premises deployment capability, and cross-service data consistency.

The system follows a modular monolith approach with clear service boundaries, enabling future decomposition into microservices if needed. All components are self-hosted and containerized, meeting Banking & Financial Services compliance requirements (SOC 2, GDPR, PCI-DSS awareness, ISO 27001).

**Core Architectural Principles:**
1. **Trust through verifiability** - Citation assembly is THE core differentiator
2. **On-premises first** - All components self-hosted, air-gap capable
3. **Eventual consistency with guarantees** - Transactional outbox pattern for cross-service operations
4. **Boring technology that works** - Proven, stable choices over cutting-edge experiments
5. **Retrieval strategy abstraction** - Support vector-only and graph-augmented retrieval interchangeably
